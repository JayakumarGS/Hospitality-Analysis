# Hospitality-Analysis
# AtliQ Grand Data Analysis Project
# Project Overview
AtliQ Grand is a five-star hotel chain operating in major Indian cities including Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, and Bangalore. In response to declining revenue and market share, this project was initiated to generate actionable insights that help drive strategic decisions.
